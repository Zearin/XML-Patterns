                      completely separated from the processing
                      instructions, External Assistant solves the
                      problem of how to add external computation.

                      other feed a transformation process that
                      generates output in the form of an HTML file.
                      In this context, External Assistant explains
                      how to call an external process whose results
                      are incorporated to the output, always

                      page. Any opaque application running on any
                      platform can to provide XML input. An XSL

                      Wrapper is very similar to the famous Adapter
                      pattern. The difference between the patterns
                      is not predominantly structural, but rather
                      in their intentions: Adapter seeks to make an
                      existing object work with other known objects
                      that expect something, while Wrapper is
                      focused on providing a different interface

                      The XML-Acceptor pattern describes sending
                      distributed messages via an XML string.
                      Sending a all messages as a single string
                      allows for the interface of the service to
                      remain the same even if the contents of the
                      message changes.

                      From the pattern: "a pattern that solves the
                      problem of transferring data between foreign
                      applications by automatically collecting data
                      from those applications on behalf of a
                      working client collector. It uses a process
                      that collects XML data from data providers.
                      This process takes the different feeds and
                      builds a compilation of the data in an XML
                      document, even when foreign applications run
                      on different platforms. Through this pattern,
                      a thin client receives distributed
                      information that it requires. Furthermore,
                      the process of collecting information is
                      transparent to the user (usually a person at
                      a browser, but potentially an automated
                      process) except when he declares what data he
                      requires."
