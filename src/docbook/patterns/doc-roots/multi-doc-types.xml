		<title>Multiple Document Types</title>

		<abstract>
			<para>When a system needs to represent a range of different document types, each document
				type can be represented by a completely separate declarations.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Problem</title>
		<para>A system needs to represent different types of information. This information may be
			used at different times, or may be used by different parts of the system.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Context</title>
		<para>Systems which need to represent a variety of information at different times or
			places.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Forces</title>
		<para>Processing and authoring of documents can be simplified if different document types
			are used to represent different sets of data.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Solution</title>
		<para>Use different document types to represent different sets of data within the
			system.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Examples</title>
		<para>In a payroll system, data about the Employees, and data about the hours they work can
			be represented by separate documents.</para>

		<example>
			<title>Employees.dtd:</title>

			<programlisting language="dtd"><![CDATA[
<!ELEMENT Employee (Name, HourlyRate)>
<!ATTLIST Employee id ID #REQUIRED>

<!ELEMENT Name (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT HourlyRate (#PCDATA)>
			]]></programlisting>
		</example>


		<example>
			<title>HoursWorked.dtd:</title>

			<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<!ELEMENT PayPeriod (Employee+)>
<!ATTLIST PayPeriod
StartDate #CDATA
EndDate   #CDATA>

<!ELEMENT Employee (HoursWorked)>
<!ATTLIST Employee id NMTOKEN>

<!ELEMENT HoursWorked (#PCDATA)>
			]]></programlisting>
		</example>

		<title>Discussion</title>

		<para>If different people will authoring the different types of documents it is a good idea
			to have completely separate document types, because authors will not need to be exposed
			to parts of the document types that are not needed.</para>
		<para>Having separate document types allows the different DTDs to be versioned
			independently.</para>

		<para><link xl:href="/patterns/doc-roots/universal-root.xml">Universal Root</link> allows multiple types of data under one document root. Multi Root
			Document Types allows for multiple types of documents to be declared in a single
